# GitHub Profile Analyzer

## Overview

The **GitHub Profile Analyzer** is a tool designed to provide detailed insights into a GitHub user's profile. It allows users to explore repositories, analyze contributions, and retrieve key activity metrics using a natural language interface powered by advanced AI models.

## Features

- **Profile Summary:** Get an overview of a user's contributions, popular languages, and repository statistics.
- **Repository Analysis:** Analyze repository details like stars, forks, and activity trends.
- **Interactive Querying:** Use natural language to ask questions about the profile.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Explore the profile through an intuitive Gradio-based interface.

# Future Plans for Repository Enhancements

## Enhanced NLP Queries
Our goal is to enhance the natural language processing capabilities to support more **advanced and specific user queries**, such as:
- Detailed statistics (e.g., top contributors, most forked repositories)
- Advanced repository analysis (e.g., commit history trends, issues over time)

This will enable more intuitive interactions with the repository data.

## Additional Integrations
We plan to integrate with other services such as:
- **GitHub Actions**: Display build/test status and commit frequency.
- **Other GitHub APIs**: Include insights from issues, pull requests, and more.

These integrations will provide a richer and more comprehensive view of the repository's health and activity.
Stay tuned for these exciting updates!
